  	<h3>
  		Theme: Tools to make games & What is new the latest Ruby?
  	</h3>

  	<p>
  		<p>
  Join us for our January 8 meetup where we have <a href="http://blog.aventine.se/" title="Jens' blog">Jens Nockert</a> talking <b>about computer game-making tools</b>.
</p>

<p>
  Later, Olle Jonsson will try to show <b>what new things</b> have been added to the <b>Ruby programming language</b> in its latest version, which was just released.
</p>

<h3>Target Audience</h3>

<p>This is a free event for people interested in Ruby.</p>

<p>
  We welcome both experienced programmers and total beginners to our events. In fact, we take great pride in making a welcoming atmosphere to newcomers to tech.
</p>

<p>
  If this is your first time, you may find the <a href="/about/how_to_malmorb.html">How To Malmö.rb</a> page helpful.

		<h3>
			Planned Activities
		</h3>

    <p>
      We'll have a string of talks for you, interpolated by some snacks and time to
meet the other attendees.

    </p>

	  <h4>
	  	Jens Nockert: <em>Using Ruby in your game asset pipeline</em>
	  </h4>

	  <p class="talk-description"><p>
  When you make games, you manage a lot of images, sounds, animations, and so on - collectively known as <i>assets</i>. A game asset pipeline
  is a series of tools that build usable game assets out of the
  source material created by artists.
</p>

<p>For example:
  "Take this directory of MP3 files
  and turn them into FLAC files which can be used for one of our supported
  platforms." or "Take each 3D model of a playable character and turn it into a smaller icon picture version of itself, to be shown in the high-score screen."
</p>

<p>
  Jens will take a deep look at extending an old but still-working asset pipeline based around <a href="http://www.radgametools.com/granny.html">RAD Granny 3D</a> and bringing it to the web with Ruby, Rake, and liberal application of a hex editor.
</p>

<p>
  We’ll look at the open-source (and official) <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/">EVE: Online</a> renderer <a href=https://github.com/ccpgames/ccpwgl>CCPWGL</a> and its assets as a case study.
</p>

<p>
  There will be Ruby, C and JavaScript shown, but only basic programming knowledge will be assumed. No game or Ruby experience required.
</p>
</p>
	  <h4>
	  	Olle Jonsson: <em>Art exercise: What is new in Ruby 2.6?</em>
	  </h4>

	  <p class="talk-description"><p>
  Some holidays bring a new Ruby version, this time we got Ruby 2.6. What changed? What new patterns emerge? What can you do with the new features? What new magic is possible?
</p>

<p>
  We will go through the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/12/25/ruby-2-6-0-released/">release announcement</a>,
  perhaps not all of it, but the best of it.
</p>

<p>
  There will be art materials, we will split into groups, and we will
  create explanations.
</p>

    <h3>What is Ruby?</h3>

<p>
  Ruby is a programming language which says it "optimizes
  for programmer happiness". We've started a separate
  <a href="/about/ruby.html">Introduction to Ruby page</a>,
  to get you up to speed.
</p>

<h3>The location</h3>

<p>It's on the first floor, but there's an elevator.</p>

<h3>When is it?</h3>

<p>
  Just after office hours, say 17:30, and for about 3 hours.
  We try to keep the most interesting bits accessible to
  people who can not hang around too long, by placing them in
  the middle of the event's timeline.
