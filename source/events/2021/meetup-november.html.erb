      <p>
        Async is an interesting new concurrency paradigm in Ruby, best described as
        "threads with none of the downsides". It's powerful, scalable, and integrates
        seamlessly with the existing Ruby code.
      </p>

      <p>
        This talk will explain why Matz invited 'async' gem to Ruby's standard library
        and why Ruby added so many new language features, just to work better with
        Async.
      </p>

      <p>
        Async Ruby was in stealth development mode for years, and now it's finally ready
        for prime-time. Come learn about the most innovative feature added to Ruby in
        years.

<h3>The location</h3>

<p>
  <b>DGI Byen</b> is at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?saddr=My+Location&daddr=55.6695423,12.56463610000003">Tietgensgade 65, 1704 København, Danmark</a>
  That’s within walking distance

   It is fully accessible to people with mobility issues.</p>

<h3>When is it?</h3>

<p>
  <b>17:30-19:30</b>.
  Just after office hours, say 17:30, and – this time – for 2 hours.

  We try to keep the most interesting bits accessible to
  people who can not hang around too long, by placing them in
  the middle of the event’s timeline.
</p>

<h3>Snacks</h3>

<p>
  None. <b>Zero snacks have been confirmed.</b>
</p>

<h3>By the way: What is Ruby?</h3>

<p>
  Ruby is a programming language which says it “optimizes
  for programmer happiness”. We’ve started a separate
  <a href="/about/ruby.html">Introduction to Ruby page</a>,
  to get you up to speed.
