  - name: Chris Mckenzie
    talk_title: "Metaprogramming in Ruby"
    talk_description: |
      <p>
        Chris is one of the driving forces of <a href="http://www.copenhagenrb.dk/">Copenhagen.rb</a>.
        Chris offers a tour of metaprogramming!
      </p>
      <p>
        A powerful and effective programming technique, <b>metaprogramming</b> finds itself being used quite heavily within the Ruby community. We'll be having a look at some of the <b>usages</b> of it in the wild and then taking a deep dive into how we can use it ourselves. Metaprogramming however <b>isn't without dangers</b>, knowing how to avoid common pitfalls is also very important. It can however also be a great opportunity to be <b>a little mischievous</b> and cause <b>a little havoc</b> amongst friends.

<h3>The location</h3>

<p>
  <b>DGI Byen</b> is at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?saddr=My+Location&daddr=55.6695423,12.56463610000003">Tietgensgade 65, 1704 København, Danmark</a>
  That’s within walking distance
  of <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5096749954">København H</a> where the trains stop. The building is a huge box.
</p>

<p>The location is on the ground floor, and doors open with motors.
   It is fully accessible to people with mobility issues.</p>

<h3>When is it?</h3>

<p>
  <b>17:30-19:30</b>.
  Just after office hours, say 17:30, and – this time – for 2 hours.

  We try to keep the most interesting bits accessible to
  people who can not hang around too long, by placing them in
  the middle of the event’s timeline.
</p>

<h3>Snacks</h3>

<p>
  None. <b>Zero snacks have been confirmed.</b>
</p>

<h3>By the way: What is Ruby?</h3>

<p>
  Ruby is a programming language which says it “optimizes
  for programmer happiness”. We’ve started a separate
  <a href="/about/ruby.html">Introduction to Ruby page</a>,
  to get you up to speed.
