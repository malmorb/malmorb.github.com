    </p>

    <p>
      Later, Olle Jonsson will try to show <b>what new things</b> have been added to the <b>Ruby programming language</b> in its latest version, which was just released.
    </p>

    <h3>Target Audience</h3>

    <p>This is a free event for people interested in Ruby.</p>

  We'll have a string of talks for you, interpolated by some snacks and time to
  meet the other attendees.

    talk_title: Using Ruby in your game asset pipeline
    talk_description: |
      <p>
        When you make games, you manage a lot of images, sounds, animations, and so on - collectively known as <i>assets</i>. A game asset pipeline
        is a series of tools that build usable game assets out of the
        source material created by artists.
      </p>

      <p>For example:
        "Take this directory of MP3 files
        and turn them into FLAC files which can be used for one of our supported
        platforms." or "Take each 3D model of a playable character and turn it into a smaller icon picture version of itself, to be shown in the high-score screen."
      </p>

      <p>
        Jens will take a deep look at extending an old but still-working asset pipeline based around <a href="http://www.radgametools.com/granny.html">RAD Granny 3D</a> and bringing it to the web with Ruby, Rake, and liberal application of a hex editor.
      </p>

      <p>
        We’ll look at the open-source (and official) <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/">EVE: Online</a> renderer <a href=https://github.com/ccpgames/ccpwgl>CCPWGL</a> and its assets as a case study.
      </p>

      <p>
        There will be Ruby, C and JavaScript shown, but only basic programming knowledge will be assumed. No game or Ruby experience required.
      </p>

    talk_title: Art exercise: What is new in Ruby 2.6?
    talk_description: |
      <p>
        Some holidays bring a new Ruby version, this time we got Ruby 2.6. What changed? What new patterns emerge? What can you do with the new features? What new magic is possible?
      </p>

      <p>
        We will go through the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/12/25/ruby-2-6-0-released/">release announcement</a>,
        perhaps not all of it, but the best of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        There will be art materials, we will split into groups, and we will
        create explanations.
      </p>

<h3>What is Ruby?</h3>

<p>
  Ruby is a programming language which says it "optimizes
  for programmer happiness". We've started a separate
  <a href="/about/ruby.html">Introduction to Ruby page</a>,
  to get you up to speed.
</p>

<h3>The location</h3>

<p>It's on the first floor, but there's an elevator.</p>
